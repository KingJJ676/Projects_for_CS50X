I created a website demo for the club I attended using CSS, HTML and Javascript.  
The website links to our club's actual social media accounts and provides detail information about each year's program when the user clicked on the photo.  
Note that since this isn't the official website of the club(just for my personal practice), I did not actually publish it.  
Yet, below is a demo video of what it looks like.
